### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, there!

I'm Baktiyar Assylzhan, a computer science student interested in full stack web development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a pathfinding algorithms visualizer web app. I'm excited to create an intuitive way to visualize and learn about popular pathfinding algorithms.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.js and Express.js to improve my full stack web development skills. I'm always looking for ways to improve and expand my knowledge.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to web development, algorithms and data structures. I'm always happy to discuss and share knowledge!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at assylzhanb@unist.ac.kr. Feel free to reach out to me for any opportunities or just to say hi!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love Game of Thrones

Let's connect and make some awesome things together!
